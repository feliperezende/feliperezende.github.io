Open your Apache configuration file. Possible locations include /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf (Apache 2/httpd), /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ (Apache 2.4), or /etc/apache2/apache2.conf (Apache on Ubuntu).

Add a rewrite rule to the VirtualHost section of your configuration file similar to the following:

{% highlight apache %}
<VirtualHost *:80>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} =http
    RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP:Host}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
{% endhighlight %}

Save your Apache configuration file.

Restart Apache.
